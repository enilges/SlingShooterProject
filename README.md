aspect ratio in unity should be 5:4
I used 'maximize on play'
graphics quality and position of text and buttons may change because of different screen sizes (my screen is 1920 x 1080)

I was unable to provide a game build as well because my sourcetree wasn't able to handle pushing it, I do however recommend building the game and running it from the build instead of running it from unity, mainly because of the different screen sizes

GameBuild.exe ideal screen: 1152 x 864 (assuming the size i set (1115 x 892) doesn't show up), windowed(!), menu should be the first level (assuming the build settings don't transfer)
